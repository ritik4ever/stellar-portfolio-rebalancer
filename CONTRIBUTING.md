- OpenAPI maintenance (`cd backend && npm run openapi:export` and `npm run api:validate` — see [backend/docs/openapi.md](backend/docs/openapi.md))
- Queue worker setup and expectations
- Frontend E2E tests with Playwright
- Contract build and deploy steps
- Common setup failures and fixes

For a quick overview of the API contract see [API.md](API.md). Background services and troubleshooting are covered in [docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md). Feature flags are summarized in [docs/FEATURE_FLAGS.md](docs/FEATURE_FLAGS.md), and Soroban event shapes for the indexer are in [docs/CONTRACT_EVENTS.md](docs/CONTRACT_EVENTS.md).

## Workflow
